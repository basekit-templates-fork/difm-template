# DIFM Template
This has been created to demonstrate how to use tempaltes as a foundation to create DIFM websites.

There are LESS mixins contained in the custom-difm.less file that can be used to change the layout and design of the template. The idea is to change these form the template code editor within the BaseKit app.

As always, changes to content and images can also be made within the BaseKit site editor.
